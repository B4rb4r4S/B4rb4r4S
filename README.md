- 👋 Hi, I’m @B4rb4r4S
- 👀 I am interested in data science, data mining, analysis and application of the information obtained for supporting interesting projects such as those to help the community and the environment. I think evolution has to be accompanied by technology.
- 🌱 I’m currently preparing to get Azure Fundamentals certification. Later, I would love to continue with Azure Data Scientist Associate certification.
- 💞️ I'd like to collaborate on interesting projects data-driven to leverage my skills and support decision-making.
